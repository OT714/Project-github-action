>> What is Github-action
  
  Github-action is a platform to automate software development workflows. It is a kind of CICD tool and CICD pipeline 
   is one of many workflows that you can automate with Github-action.

       
>> Developer workflow uses cases

# What are those developer workflows?

      In a Github organization we need to generally accomplish multiple tasks for the teams to work collaboratively:

      - if an issue arise you want to check if it is minor or major
      - if it reproducable
      - assign it to a contibutor
                                  - if a PR is created you want to review the platform
                                  - if the bug is fixed in case you have a bug
                                  - you want to merge to master branch if everything look good

                                                                    - Start build the CICD
                                                                    - If everything look good you will prepare a release note
                                                                    - update version number

>> Basic concepts: Github Events and Actions


 we want to automate this process above as much as possible so that developers can be concentrate on developing 
    more features and code. For that to happen we need to implement Github-action.

    So when something happens IN or TO the repository we can configure automatic actions which will be executed in response.
    The things happening IN or TO the repo are called Events:
      - someone created a PR
      - someone joined the repository(contributor)
      - someone created an issue
      - someone merged the PR into the master branch
      - others apps integrate to our tools can also produce such events.


    To automate the workflows you to : 

      - Litsen to the Events : PR, contr. joined, issue created, PR merged, others apps integrate

      - Trigger workflows : if one of this Events occurs a specific workflows will be trigger automatically  

            Exple: Someone created an issue, you would like to automatically sort the issue, label it, assign it 
                   to a specific person, maybe write a script or test which will try to automatically reproduce the issue.
                   All these things are automated with actions. Each of these actions are separate (sort, label...) 
                   and the chain of those actions are what we call workflow.

>> CICD pipeline with Github Actions!

  Most common workflow for our repository are:

   Code commit >> Test >> Build >> Push >> Deploy

  So instead of setup a complete CICD tool Github-action ease the process because we don't need a third party integration
   tool and also setup the CICD pipeline is easy. Developer will have a quick access to a CiCD tool for their tasks.
    Github-action give you an environment in which Nodes and Docker are available, version can be specified, It can be 
    simply connect to the target  and deploy.
